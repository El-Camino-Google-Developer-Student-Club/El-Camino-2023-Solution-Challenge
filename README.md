  Welcome to El Camino College's Google Development Student club flutter application. This application is designed to help students figure out which classes they are required to take so they do not spend more money then needed. Here we are using google technologies such as Firebase, Flutter and Dart to create this project. In order to get this application to work, follow the following steps.
Step 1 - install VS Code.
Step 2 - Install Flutter and Dart files/sdk.
Step 3 - Open a Flutter application using Ctrl + shift + p (If on Apple ios, use command + shift + p).
step 4 - set the environment to be chrome web and run the flutter project in the root file from the command line.
step 5 - once the program has started, you can select which institution you are in.
step 6 - Then select the course you are trying to complete.
step 7 - Once done the program will post some schools on the map on the right hand side that offer the class equivalance. Results will also display on the left hand side of courses that are acceptable.
Step 8 - When finished close the application by clicking on the x-button.
